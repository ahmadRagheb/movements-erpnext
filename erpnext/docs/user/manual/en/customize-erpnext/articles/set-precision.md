#Set Precision

In ERPNext, default precision for `Float`, `Currency` and `Percent` field is three. It allows you to enter value having value upto three decimal places.

You can also change/customize the precision settings globally or for a specific field.

To change the precision globally, go to:

`Setup > Settings > System Settings`.

You can also set field specific precision. To do that go to `Setup > Customize > Customize Form` and select the DocType there. Then go to the specific field row and change precision. Precision field is only visible if field-type is one of the Float, Currency and Percent.
