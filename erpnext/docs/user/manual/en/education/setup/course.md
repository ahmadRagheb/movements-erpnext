# Course

 A course is a unit of teaching that typically lasts one academic term, is led by one or more instructors (teachers or professors), and has a fixed number of students. Students may receive a grade and academic credit after completion of the course.

To create a **Course** enter the Course name and Code. Code for the course should be unique for every course. You can also link the department under which the course is conducted.
