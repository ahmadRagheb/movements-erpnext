# Production Planning Tool

Production Planning Tool helps you plan production and purchase of Items for a
period (usually a week or a month).

This list of Items can be generated from the open Sales Orders or pending Material Requests that can be Manufactured in the system
and will generate:

  * Production Orders for each Item.
  * Purchase Requests for Items whose Projected Quantity is likely to fall below zero.

To use the Production Planning Tool, go to:

> Manufacturing > Tools > Production Planning Tool

#### Step 1: Specify source to get Production Items

* You can select Sales Order or Material Request according to where you want to source the items from
* If you plan to add items manually, keep the "Get items from" field empty



#### Step 2: Select and get Sales Order / Material Request

* Use filters to get the Sales Order / Material Request
* Click on Get Sales Order / Get Material Requests to generate a list.

The Production Planning Tool is used in two stages:

  * Selection of open Sales Orders / pending Material Request for the period based on “Expected Delivery Date”.
  * Selection of Items from those Sales Orders / Material Requests

The tool will update if you have already created Production Orde rs for a
particular Item against its Sales Order (“Planned Quantity”) or Material Request.

You can always edit the Item list and increase / reduce quantities to plan
your production.

> Note: How do you change a Production Plan? The output of the Production
Planning Tool is the Production Order. Once your orders are created, you can
change them by amending the Production Orders.
