### Managing time

ERPNext uses [Time Log](/docs/user/manual/en/projects/time-log.html) to track the progress of a Project.
You can create Time Logs against each task.
The Actual Start and End Time along with the costing shall then be updated based on the Time Log.

* You can also create a Time Log directlly and link it to the Project.

The system shall update the total amount from expense claims in the project costing section.

* To view Expense Claims made against a Project click on 'Expense Claims'

<img class="screenshot" alt="Project - View Expense Claim" src="/docs/assets/img/project/project_view_expense_claim.png">

<img class="screenshot" alt="Project - Total Expense Claim" src="/docs/assets/img/project/project_total_expense_claim.png">

### Cost Center

You can make a [Cost Center](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts/setup/cost-center.html) against a Project or use an existing cost center to track all expenses made against that project.

###Project Costing

The Project Costing section helps you track the time, expenses and purchases incurred against the project.

<img class="screenshot" alt="Project - Costing" src="/docs/assets/img/project/project_costing.png">

* The Total Cost is composed of the costing amount from timesheets, the total cost from expense claims and the total cost from purchase invoices created against this project.

* The Gross Margin is the difference between Total Billed Amount and the Total Cost Amount for this project.

###Billing

You can make/link a [Sales Order](/docs/user/manual/en/selling/sales-order.html) against a project. Once linked you can use the standard sales module to bill your customer against the Project.
