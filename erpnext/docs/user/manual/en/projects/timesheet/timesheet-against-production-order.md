#Timesheet based on Production Order

Creating Timesheet for Production Order helps in capacity planning for the Workstations. Also it helps in tracking actual time consumed the Workstation for completing specific operation.

When a Production Order is submitted, based on the Planned Start Date and the availability of the Workstations, system schedules all operations by creating Timesheet.

Let's assume we are manufacturing a mobile phone. As per the Bill of Material, time required for the assembly of components could be one hour. However the actual time taken for it's completion could be more than planned. The actual time tracking provides actual operation cost, hence helps in determining accurate valuation of the manufacturing item.

####Production Order

As per the Bill of Materials of manufacturing item, following are the Operations and Workstation through which raw-material items are processed.
