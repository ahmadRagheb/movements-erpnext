# Print Style

Frappe/ERPNext comes with pre-set styles for your printed documents. You can also create new styles using CSS that can be applied to all your print formats.

To create a new **Print Style** go to **Setup > Printing and Branding > Print Style**, or just type "print style" in the search bar.

Here you can define the CSS rules for your print formats. These apply to both standard and custom print formats. To find out the various classes available, you can make a standard print format, open in a new page and see the source.

To set a default style, you can go to [Print Settings](/docs/setup/print/print-settings)

All Print Format styles are based on Bootstrap (Version 3) CSS Framework.
