# Administrator User

If your ERPNext account is hosted with us (Frappe Technologies Pvt. Ltd.), then you won't be able to access your ERPNext account as an Administrator. For the hosted account, access via Administrator User us reserved with us.

1.  For the hosted account, upgrades are managed from the backend. We reserve admin login credential with us so that we can upgrade all the hosted customer's ERPNext accounts from the backend. 

2.  Since on a single server, we host have many customer's ERPNext accounts, as a security measure, we cannot share the credentials for administrator account with any hosted user.
