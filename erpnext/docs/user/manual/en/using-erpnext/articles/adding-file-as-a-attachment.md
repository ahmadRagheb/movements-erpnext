#Adding File as a Attachment

ERPNext allows to attach files with documents. User with a read permission on particular document will also be able to access files attached with it.

###Attach New File

There are several ways to attach file to the document.

####From Browser

<img alt="Sales Order File Attachment" class="screenshot" src="/docs/assets/img/articles/attach-file-1.gif">

####By drag and drop

<img alt="Sales Order File Attachment" class="screenshot" src="/docs/assets/img/articles/attach-file-2.gif">

Click on Attach to browse and select the file.

####Link

If you use separate server for files, or use online service like Dropbox, you can attach file by providing link of a particular file.

`For hosted users, limit of 5 MB is applied on file size.`

To ensure there are not many files attached to a document, which can affect your accounts performance, you can set limit as how many files can be attached to a particular document. Click [here](/docs/user/manual/en/customize-erpnext/articles/increase-max-attachments.html) to learn more about it.
