#POS View

POS (point of sale) view renders form in a different layout, optimized for the quick selection of items. This view has primarily been designed for the retail business.

Using POS View, you can only create Sales Invoice, without switching to standard form view. For other transactions, like Sales Order, Delivery Note, Purchase Order, Purchase Receipt etc., POS View is only used for Item selection. For entering other values in the transaction, you should switch to form view.
