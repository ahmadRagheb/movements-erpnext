# Add Products To Website

### Add Products to the Website

ERPNext will populate your website with products out of your Item Master. The html code will be
generated automatically.

#### Step 1: Edit Item

For this example we will add a rocking chair to our catalog to sell on our website.

To edit a catalog item go to: `Stock > Items and Pricing > Item`.  From there select an item to add to website or create a new item by clicking the **New** button in the upper right.

For this example, click on the **New** button to create a new item.  Fill in the form and then click **Save**.
